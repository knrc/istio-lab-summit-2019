Apply circuit breaking, timeout handling, and circuit breaking

:toc:

== What we will learn in this module
This module will provide instruction on request retries, handling of service timeouts, and how to apply
circuit breaking. This module will also how to visualize these capabilities in Kiali.

[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have only the following virtualservices and destinationrules in the `istio-tutorial` namespace

[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial get destinationrule
No resources found.

$ oc -n istio-tutorial get virtualservice
NAME       GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     18h
----
====

[#retry]
== Retry

Instead of failing immediately, ServiceMesh will retry the Service N more times.
We will make pod recommendation-v2 fail 100% of the time. Get one of the pod names from your system and replace on the following command accordingly:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s localhost:8080/misbehave

Following requests to / will return a 503
----

This is a special endpoint that will make our application return only `503`s.

You will see it works every time because ServiceMesh will retry the recommendation service *automatically* and it will land on v1 or v3 only.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5290
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5279
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5291
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5280

=== Kiali's Graph

In Kiali, go to `Graph`, select the `recommendation` square, and place the mouse over the red sign, like the picture bellow.

[#img-503]
.Kiali Graph Retry
image:retry.png[]

Note that recommendation v2 has no traffic logged, but the the client has a 100% success rate due to the retries.

Now, make the pod v2 behave well again:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s localhost:8080/behave

Following requests to / will return 200
----

The application is back to random load-balancing between v1, v2 and v3

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5282
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 5267
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5294
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5283
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 5268
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5295
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5284
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 5269
----

[#timeout]
== Timeout

Now we will configure a service to wait only N seconds before giving up and failing.
First, introduce some wait time in `recommendation v2` by making it a slow performer with a 3 second delay by running the command

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=3

Timeout has been set to 3 seconds
----

Hit the customer endpoint a few times, to see the load-balancing between v1, v2 and v3 but with v2 taking a bit of time to respond

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

[#img-timeout-v1]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Recommendation v1
image:timeout-v1.png[]

[#img-timeout-v2]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Recommendation v2
image:timeout-v2.png[]

Note the duration of v2 is 3s compared to the ms time of v1.

Then add the timeout rule. To see how this is done,
take a look at link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml[virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml]

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

spec:
  hosts:

  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
    timeout: 1.000s
----

Note the 1s timeout for the recommendation destination.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial create -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml

virtualservice.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
----

You will see it return v1 after waiting about 1 second. You don't see v2 anymore, because the response from v2 expires after the timeout period and it is never returned.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)

----

[#img-timeout]
.Kiali Graph for Timeout Rule
image:timeout.png[]

Note that recommendation v2 now has a 100% failure rate due to the timeout rule

=== Clean up

Change the implementation of `v2` back to the image that responds without the delay of 3 seconds:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=0

Timeout has been set to 0 seconds
----

Then delete the virtual service created for timeout by:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml

[#failfast]
== Fail Fast with Max Connections and Max Pending Requests

Let's use a 34/33/33 split of traffic.

Note the weighting of the 3 recommendation destination versions.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

Note all recommendation hits are in the ms range

[#nocircuitbreaker]
=== Load test without circuit breaker

Next, introduce some wait time in `recommendation v2` by making it a slow performer with a 3 second delay by running the command

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=3

Timeout has been set to 3 seconds
----

Let's perform a load test in our system. We'll have 20 concurrent requests:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/loadtest.sh)
----

[#img-nocicuitgraph]
.Kiali Graph Fail Fast w/no Circuit Breaking
image:nocircuit-graph.png[]

[#img-nocicuit]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Fail Fast w/no Circuit Breaking
image:nocircuit.png[]

All of the requests to our system were successful, but 1/3 of the requests took longer time, as the `v2` instance/pod was a slow performer.

[#circuitbreaker]
=== Load test with circuit breaker

But suppose that in a production system this 3s delay was caused by too many concurrent requests to the same instance/pod.
We don't want multiple requests getting queued or making the instance/pod even slower. So we'll add a circuit breaker that
will *open* whenever we have more than 1 request being handled by any instance/pod. To see how this is done,
take a look at link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml[destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml]

----

Note the connection pool with a max of 1 pending request and a traffic policy where 100% of single consecutive errors fail.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc apply -n istio-tutorial -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation configured
----

Now let's see what is the behavior of the system running some load again:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/loadtest.sh)

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation configured
----

[#img-cicuit] []
.Kiali Graph Fail Fast w/Circuit Breaking
image:circuit-graph.png[]

You should see some some failures in the results. That's the circuit breaker being opened whenever ServiceMesh detects more than 1 pending request being handled by the instance/pod.

=== Clean up

Change the implementation of `v2` back to the image that responds without the delay of 3 seconds:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=0

Timeout has been set to 0 seconds
----

Then delete the virtual service created for circuit braking by:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-split.yml

virtualservice.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
----

== What we learned in this module
Service Mesh and Kiali provide the ability to configure, handle, and visualize service retry behavior, service timeouts,
and service circuit breaking.
